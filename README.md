Election Grabber
================

This is a quick-and-dirty script to scrape the election results for
California's June 5, 2012 Primary election results from the
California Secretary of State's [web site](http://vote.sos.ca.gov/)
and generate an overview of the results of the new top-two system.

This script was necessary because when I [contacted](http://vote.sos.ca.gov/contact/)
the Secretary of State's Elections Division staff at (916) 657-2166 to ask
if I could have the preliminary election results as a single file (e.g.
as a spreadsheet), the person on the phone responded that they would not
do so until the results are finalized because doing so would allow the
results to be "manipulated."  Absurd.

In any case, this script took less than an hour.
